        <p class="head">What are Pesticides?</p>
        <p class="sol">Pesticides are chemical substances that are meant to kill pests. In general, a pesticide is a chemical or a biological agent such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant that deters, incapacitates, kills, pests.</p>
        <p class="sol">This use of pesticides is so common that the term pesticide is often treated as synonymous with plant protection product. It is commonly used to eliminate or control a variety of agricultural pests that can damage crops and livestock and reduce farm productivity. The most commonly applied pesticides are insecticides to kill insects, herbicides to kill weeds, rodenticides to kill rodents, and fungicides to control fungi, mould, and mildew.</p>

        <p class="head">Types of Pesticides</p>
        <p class="sol">These are grouped according to the types of pests which they kill: <br><br>Grouped by Types of Pests They Kill
        <ul>
            <li>Insecticides – insects</li>
            <li>Herbicides – plants</li>
            <li>Rodenticides – rodents (rats & mice)</li>
            <li>Fungicides – fungi</li>
            <li>Bactericides – bacteria</li>
            <li>Larvicides – larvae</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p class="sol">Based on how biodegradable they are: <br><br><div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 20px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biodegradable:</span><br><span style="margin:10px 10px 10px 10px">The biodegradable kind is those which can be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Persistent:</span><br><span style="margin:10px 10px 10px 10px">While the persistent ones are those which may take months or years to break down.</span></div></p><br>
        <p class="sol">Another way to classify these is to consider those that are chemical forms or are derived from a common source or production method.</p>

However, the enzyme effects are usually reversible.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organochlorine insecticides:</span><br><span>They were commonly used earlier, but now many countries have been removed Organochlorine insecticides from their market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g., DDT, chlordane, and toxaphene).</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pyrethroid:</span><br><span>These are a synthetic version of pyrethrin, a naturally occurring pesticide, found in chrysanthemums(Flower).
